  abstract={Conventional methods for adjusting the weights of artificial neural networks only consider the output layer when calculating the loss. Our method also takes into account infor-mation from the functions generating the outputs of the neurons in the second to last layer,which are called feature functions. Specifically, we measure how orthogonal the feature functions are using a covariance measure. We incorporate a term in the loss to explicitly rewardorthogonal feature functions. We were then able to generate nearly orthogonal feature functions without compromising on accuracy. Due to the convenient mathematical properties oforthogonal feature functions, we will in a future next step be able to find the optimal choiceof weights between the second to last and the output layer with low computational cost.},

  title={Thermal and mechanical properties of commodity polymers},
  author={Schär, Sabine and Münzel, Lukas},
  year={2020},
  abstract={The purpose of this project was to investigate commodity polymers. Two commercial polymers, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), as well as polystyrene (PS), synthesised by free radical polymerisation were investigated in terms of molecular characteristics, thermal properties and a clear difference between the polymers was noted. Additionally, the mechanical properties of HDPE and LLDPE were investigated and most interestingly, a difference in the tensile strength of HDPE and LLDPE was observed, even though they consist of the same monomer and just vary in their macromolecular architecture.

  abstract={This work shows that distributions of the word length, word occurrences and sentence lengths are in huge parts invariant, regardless of author or language. Nevertheless, all distributions show statistically significant differences with two sample t-test for different books. Furthermore, a Pearson’s correlation test revealed a statistically significant positive correlation between the amount of words used per sentence and the amount of characters per word.},
