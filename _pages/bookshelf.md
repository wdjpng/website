note: some reviews contain a near-minimal amount of spoilers to give an idea of what the book is about

*9/10 Lord of the Rings, JRR Tolkien*
A beautifully written book which describes to adventurous journey of a small group of travelers trying to get rid of a ring of power by throwing it into a volcano deep into their enemie's lands. The world building is also simply superb - one constantly feels like there is an ancient and magnificent background history of which one only catches glimpses through the eyes of the protagonists. This two-sentence summary does no justice to this amazing book, so here is one of the poems it contains:

>"The Road goes ever on and on,  
> Down from the door where it began.  
> Now far ahead the Road has gone,  
> And I must follow, if I can,  
> Pursuing it with eager feet,  
> Until it joins some larger way  
> Where many paths and errands meet.  
> And whither then? I cannot say."


*7/10* *The Paper Menagerie and Other Stories, Ken Liu* A collection of short stories, some which I found absolutely wonderful. In particular, *All the Flavors* and *The paper mengaerie* beautifully describe the experience of Chinese immigrants into the US, in the former case even with some really interesting historic background that is elaborated in the book's footnotes

*7.6/10 The name of the Wind*- A great Fantasy book with good writing, some quite unique ideas in its world building and a captivating story. I don't want to spoil more, just read the first one or two chapters online and see whether it's your cup of tea.

*8/10 Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality* What if Harry Potter was raised by an Oxford professor instead of Vernon Dursley? This book answers the question in the form of a 600'000 word fan-fiction in which Harry Potter tries to analyze magic scientifically, picks professor Quirrell as his mentor and philosophizes about how incredibly easy it would be to overthrow the wizard government. A really captivating and amusing read - I read the book three or four times

*7.5/10 Cryptonomicon, Neal Stephenson* A great read with narrators split between WW2 code-breakers & accomplices and on the other hand their grand-children 50 years down the line who are trying to build a regulation-free data haven and are now facing various challenges, from gold-smuggling operations to an investor who would just *love* to own a bigger share of their venture and are willing to sue them to the ground for it. The book is delightfully nerdy to a point where I sometimes nearly wondered whether the author had mysteriously been paid to write a book specifically for me.

*7/10 In remembrance of earth's past, Cixin Liu*
Pros: Science-fiction with some really, really cool concepts and descriptions of a human endeavour over an very long amount of time. It is hard to say more without spoiling half the trilogy, but it certainly makes for an interesting read
Cons: I think the author is at times a cynic and some women are quite badly written


*6.8/10 Stranger in a Strange Land* A human gets raised by Martians and then manages to return to Earth by early adulthood. The martians are never really described - the book is about the man's integration into human society, which is quite interesting given that he comes from a completely different cultural background. Also being raised by Martians apparently gives one telepathic abilities and a strong preference for polyamory.

*7/10 Surely You are Joking Mr. Feynmann* - A very amusing biography of the amazing Physicist Richard Feynmann in the form of first-person anecdotes

## Nothing deep but fun reads
*7/10 Artemis* A quick and fun read of which I frankly remember little after a few months other than that is is a cool underdog-fighting-the-evil-crime-syndicate book which was written by Any Weir, the author of *The Martian* and *Project Hail Mary*

*8/10 Circe* A very neat, kind of feminist book describing some Greek mythology from the perspective of Circe, famous for being the witch who trapped Odysseus on her island. 

*7/10 There is no antimemetic division* A short novel describing how an organization which aims to contain anomalous beings grapples with an entity that wrecks havoc only to those who remember its existence


## Other short stories
Three worlds collide - A slightly disturbing but very much thought-provoking short story imagining how alien and human moral frameworks might differ

The last question - A sufficiently short Sci-Fi short story that I will say nothing other than that it kind of neat
