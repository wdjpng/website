*Hi there!*

My main goal is to have as much positive impact as I can. I believe that the best and most interesting way to achieve this is to actively contribute to progress in machine learning. Indeed, I believe that AGI this decade or certainly within my lifetime is plausible and, if achieved, will enable rates of progress dwarfing anything we have lived through so far.

I love to meet new interesting people. Thus, if anything on this website seems interesting to you, you are more then welcome to write me a [mail](mailto:lmuenzel@student.ethz.ch?subject=Lunch) and we can gladly go for lunch or a coffee.

Cheers,

Lukas

Short summary of my CV:
* In 2021, I had the pleasure of participating in the [Research Science Institute](https://www.cee.org/programs/research-science-institute), a six-week research program held at MIT with amazing people from all over the world
* I participated in the Informatics Olympiad with reasonable success, being one of the four people to represent Switzerland internationally in 2020 and 2022 respectively. I also qualified for the final rounds of the Swiss Biology and Physics Olympiad
