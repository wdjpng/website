Code for my [personal website ](lukasmuenzel.com)

This is a fork with very little modifications of the wonderful [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio). All kudos go to them :)

The end effect of the entire spiel is that I write my pages in markdown and convert them all to a static page with a single command.
